# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

For this project I created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.


## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Learning

Through making this application I got clearer on api routes, ajax calls, get requests, and server response. I was able to understand more than before how the files work together; which files are frontend and which ones are backend; and how the ajax calls and api routes factor into the request/response process.
